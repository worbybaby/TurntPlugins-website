# Turnt Plugins Retro Website Prompt

Create a website for the audio plugins I have created that will allow users to browse and select plugins they would like to purchase/download all while enjoying a retro Windows 2.0 type aesthetic.

The user experience of the site is like interacting with a playful, creative, and dynamic workspace that feels more like a Windows 2.0 operating system inside your browser.

## User Experience

As a user, you will browse through a single page website with listings for 5 different plugins with pictures of said plugins (I will supply pictures later) over a brief description of the plugin. Across the header bar of the site will be the brand label (Turnt Plugins), about button, and cart button—all in the format of something like a retro Windows operating system environment (I like the Windows 2.0 aesthetic).

The main page can scroll if needed. When you click on the about button, a window pops up as a retro sound effect is made. The window is just text about myself and the website. Clicking on the cart button will also make a window pop up that will take you through the check out process.

## Checkout Process

The check out process will ask how much the user would like to pay for the plugin (for now, I will set hard prices later) and require their email. If they choose to pay anything greater than 0 it will take them through a checkout process requiring their credit card information (payment will be handled by my Stripe account). They must opt into receiving email from me about future plugins and projects.

## Overview

The site is a retro experience centered around artistic retro vibe and as it sells audio plugins via donation ware.

## Admin Page

On the back end please do research on the best way to present an admin page only I can access with stats and graphs and spreadsheets of customer emails and anything else a plugin sales site would need. The aesthetic should be similar for this admin page only I can see as the main website.
